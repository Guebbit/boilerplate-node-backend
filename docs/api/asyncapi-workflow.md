# AsyncAPI Workflow

## AsyncAPI is the async contract source of truth

For this boilerplate, keep REST and async contracts separate:

- REST: `openapi.yaml`
- Async/event-driven: `asyncapi.yaml`

Current scope of `asyncapi.yaml`:

- WebSocket chat channels (`realtime.chat.*`)
- SSE observability channels (`observability.*`)
- Ecommerce cart checkout event (`ecommerce.cart.checked_out`)
- RabbitMQ worker queues (`worker.email.send`, `worker.pdf.generate`)
- Redis pub/sub cache invalidation (`cache.tags.invalidated`)

## Servers declared

| Name | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `websocketLocal` | `ws` | WebSocket chat |
| `sseLocal` | `http` | SSE observability stream |
| `rabbitmqLocal` | `amqp` | Async job queues (email, PDF) |
| `redisLocal` | `redis` | Pub/sub cache invalidation |

## Generated TypeScript types

Types are generated from `asyncapi.yaml` into `src/types/asyncapi.ts` by a custom script (`scripts/gen-asyncapi-types.ts`).  
They are re-exported from `src/types/index.ts` so all app code can import them consistently:

```ts
import type { IChatMessagePayload, IEmailJobPayload, IPdfJobPayload } from '@types';
import { WORKER_CHANNELS, CACHE_CHANNELS } from '@types';
```

Regenerate types after editing `asyncapi.yaml`:

```bash
npm run gen:asyncapi-types
```

The generator (`scripts/gen-asyncapi-types.ts`) reads `asyncapi.yaml` with `js-yaml`, converts each `components.schemas` entry into a TypeScript interface, and writes the result to `src/types/asyncapi.ts`.

## Commands used in this repo

```bash
npm run lint:asyncapi       # validate asyncapi.yaml
npm run gen:asyncapi-types  # regenerate src/types/asyncapi.ts
npm run docs:asyncapi       # open AsyncAPI Studio in browser
```

## How this complements OpenAPI

- OpenAPI describes HTTP request/response APIs.
- AsyncAPI describes message/event contracts across async transports.
- Together they provide one contract layer for REST and one for real-time/event-driven flows.

## RabbitMQ queue channels

Worker queues use AMQP (RabbitMQ) for reliable async job processing:

- **`worker.email.send`** — email delivery jobs consumed by `src/workers/email.worker.ts`
- **`worker.pdf.generate`** — PDF render jobs consumed by `src/workers/pdf.worker.ts`

Both use the `IEmailJobPayload` / `IPdfJobPayload` interfaces generated from the contract. The worker types are derived from AsyncAPI — no hand-written duplicates.

## Redis pub/sub channel

- **`cache.tags.invalidated`** — broadcasts cache tag invalidations across multiple app instances so each instance can evict stale entries locally.

Uses `ICacheTagsInvalidatedPayload` from the generated types. The publisher/subscriber logic lives in `src/utils/cache.ts`.

## Naming convention

Channels use dot-separated topic-style naming (for example `ecommerce.cart.checked_out`), and Kafka publishes those exact channel names as topic names (or prefixed topic names when `NODE_KAFKA_TOPIC_PREFIX` is set).

## Realtime event names

All SSE and WebSocket event names used at runtime come from the `CHAT_CHANNELS`, `OBSERVABILITY_CHANNELS`, and `ECOMMERCE_CHANNELS` constants generated into `src/types/asyncapi.ts`.  
There are no handwritten duplicate string constants — `asyncapi.yaml` is the single source of truth.

## CI enforcement

CI runs `lint:asyncapi` and `gen:asyncapi-types`, then verifies `src/types/asyncapi.ts` has no uncommitted changes. This prevents contract drift — if you edit `asyncapi.yaml` without regenerating types, CI fails.
